## Goals
Goal is to build fully functionable vault appropriate for growth strategies

## Reasoning
1. As a base for realization OpenZeppelin's contract were chosed, because they are trusted, more time audited so trustful
2. Used IERC4626 as an interface declaring the essense of Vault. For tokens ERC20, IERC20 and SafeERC20 to make sure all token operations are safe
3. As base for project foundry was chosen as a most actual solution for building mart contract projects
